### Cybersecurity Projects – Nikola Marković
This repository contains my hands‑on cybersecurity projects and technical write‑ups.                                            
Each project demonstrates practical skills I’ve acquired through real‑world‑style labs, simulations, and technical analysis.

### Projects
- [Agent Tesla Analysis](./malware-analysis/AgentTesla/README.md) – Deobfuscated AutoIt loader, documented process injection into `RegSvcs.exe`, credential theft and keylogging functionality, and exfiltration attempts via SMTP. Includes process trees, API monitoring, and MITRE ATT&CK mapping.

- [WannaCry Ransomware Analysis](./malware-analysis/wannacry/README.md) – Static & dynamic malware analysis in an isolated lab. Documented dropped files, process chains, persistence mechanisms, targeted file types, and Tor C2 attempts.

- [Microsoft Sentinel Home Lab](./Sentinel-Lab/README.md) – Hybrid SOC lab simulating a real enterprise environment with Microsoft Sentinel, Azure Arc, pfSense, and Sysmon. Built custom detection rules and automated alerts, validated through simulated attacks.
