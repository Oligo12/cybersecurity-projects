# Agent Tesla – Malware Analysis

This is my detailed malware analysis report on the Agent Tesla sample (SHA256: 45d6ccb917bd3b9333316262ebcd56caa515385f9c2b387417ee8152a1fe798a), combining static and dynamic analysis in an isolated lab environment.

- **Read the full report here:** [AgentTesla-analysis.md](AgentTesla-Analysis.md)  
- **See all my home-lab projects here:** [cybersecurity-projects](https://github.com/Oligo12/cybersecurity-projects/tree/main)

## Executive Summary
The analysis documents Agent Tesla’s loader behavior (AutoIt), process injection into `RegSvcs.exe`, dropped support files (*Archimago*, *complacence*), and subsequent credential theft, keylogging, and exfiltration attempts via SMTP.  
It includes deobfuscated AutoIt code, API monitoring logs, observed process activity, persistence mechanisms, and MITRE ATT&CK mapping.

This repository is part of my cybersecurity project portfolio.
