# QuasarRAT – Malware Analysis

This is my detailed malware analysis report on a QuasarRAT sample (SHA256: 3662a8d4f950c9ebd0851e0b0713f2e48dfb7dd5ac3de02bae8acd1d6c4efd1d), combining static and dynamic analysis in an isolated lab environment.

## Executive Summary
The analysis documents QuasarRAT’s dropper and .NET launcher chain, configuration decryption (AES-256 with PBKDF2), certificate pinning and signature verification, and persistence via masqueraded Run keys.  
Dynamic execution showed HTTPS bootstrap traffic to Pastebin, followed by repeated TCP beacon attempts to a direct C2 server (`45.74.16.2:4444`), blocked by pfSense. No worming or lateral movement was observed.                                 

The report includes full decrypted config values, campaign metadata (*Artistry Publications*), observed persistence artifacts, pfSense firewall logs, and MITRE ATT&CK mapping.                                                        

This repository is part of my cybersecurity project portfolio.
